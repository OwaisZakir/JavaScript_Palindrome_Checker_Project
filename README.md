# Palindrome Checker Game

## Description
**Palindrome Paradox** is an engaging web application designed to allow users to effortlessly check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. This game not only serves as an entertaining challenge but also as an educational tool for understanding the concept of palindromes.
